\title{REPORT ON RESEARCH OF HOSTELS AROUND MAKERERE UNIVERSITY}
\author{Nangwale Joshua}
\maketitle

\section{Introduction}

Makerere University is one the largest public universities in Uganda and currently has almost 50,000 students. During the course of their study, the majority of students stay on campus in one the halls  of residence or in the immediate vicinity to offer convenience. There are currently  9 halls of residence on campus i.e. Lumumba, Livingstone, Nkrumah, Mitchel, University hall, Mary Stuart, Complex and Africa. These however lack the capacity to accommodate all  university students and thus many opt for private hostels located within close proximity to the university.Around 4,400 students are accomodated in the halls of residence which is less than 10\% of the student population\\ Selecting a suitable hostel for accomodation poses a challenge to several due to limited prior knowledge on those available.Thus,the hunt for suitable accomodation is for many a long and tedious process.The aim of the research was to gather relevant information on the hostels in the Makerere University vicinity that will enable meaningful comparison on pertinent factors.

\section{Methodology}
The research was carried out by actively travelling to the various hostels and conducting interviews with the relevant personnel .i.e custodians,receptionists and current residents of the hostels.The information gathered was fed into an electronic form on a mobile applicaton (ODK collect) which was later uploaded to a server.Information concerning pricing of the rooms, availability of shuttles to campus, and whether the rooms were self contained was ascertained in the interviews. Images and GPS locations of the hostels were also recorded.

A few screenshots of the application are shown below

\section{Conclusion}
From the information,it can be concluded that self contained hostels are substantially more costly than non self contained rooms and the availability of shuttles is also a factor in pricing. Hostels in closer proximity to the university are however less likely to have shuttles to campus.
The information gathered is pertinent and pivotal to all those in search of accomodation in a hostel around MUK.It provides a basis on which comparisons can be made between the available choices and elucidates the value for money to prospective residents,providing them with a clearer image of what to expect.
